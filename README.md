# TeleForge

**TeleForge** is a pre-alpha version of an unofficial Telegram client, inspired by AyuGram but enhanced with unique features and a modular architecture. The project is under active development, with modules being assembled for the first stable release. TeleForge aims to deliver advanced customization, privacy, and message-management tools while maintaining a clean and efficient codebase.

## Key Features

* **Ghost Mode** – read messages without sending read receipts.
* **Anti-Delete** – keep a local history of deleted messages.
* **Extended customization** – change UI, app icons, fonts, and color schemes.
* **Local Telegram Premium** – emulate premium features without subscription.
* **Modular architecture** – easy extension via add-on modules.
* **Ad removal** – completely remove Telegram ads.
* **Planned**: keyword/sender filters, multilingual support.

## Current Status

TeleForge is in pre-alpha. Core modules are being developed and tested for performance, security, and stability.
